# NeuralChain: A Python Framework for Modular Neural Network Architectures

NeuralChain is a Python library designed to simplify the creation, training, and deployment of complex neural network architectures. It provides a modular and extensible framework for building neural networks as chains of interconnected layers, enabling researchers and developers to easily experiment with novel architectures and optimize existing models.

This project aims to address the challenges of building and maintaining intricate neural networks, which often involve repetitive code and difficult debugging. NeuralChain offers a higher level of abstraction, allowing users to define network structures using a clear and concise syntax. It encourages code reuse through its modular design, promoting the development of reusable components that can be readily integrated into different network architectures. The framework provides built-in features for managing dependencies between layers, handling data flow, and simplifying the training process, making it easier to build and deploy sophisticated models. Ultimately, NeuralChain seeks to accelerate the development cycle for neural network applications by providing a user-friendly and powerful development environment.

The core principle of NeuralChain is to treat neural networks as a directed acyclic graph of computational nodes, where each node represents a layer or a specific operation. This approach enables users to define complex network structures with branching and merging connections, offering greater flexibility compared to traditional sequential models. The framework allows users to define custom layers and operations, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. With its focus on modularity and extensibility, NeuralChain provides a solid foundation for building cutting-edge neural network architectures and exploring new frontiers in machine learning.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Layer Design:** NeuralChain promotes a modular design where neural network components are implemented as independent, reusable layers. Each layer inherits from a base `Layer` class and implements a `forward` method for processing input data and a `backward` method for computing gradients during backpropagation. This encourages code reuse and simplifies the creation of custom layers.
*   **Chained Network Construction:** The framework allows users to construct neural networks by chaining together individual layers. This approach enables the creation of complex architectures with multiple branches and connections. The `Chain` class manages the connections between layers and handles data flow during forward and backward passes.
*   **Automatic Differentiation:** NeuralChain leverages a computational graph approach to automatically compute gradients for all layers during backpropagation. This eliminates the need for manual gradient calculations, simplifying the training process and reducing the risk of errors. The system supports a wide range of activation functions and loss functions, allowing users to customize their training pipelines.
*   **Dynamic Graph Execution:** The framework supports dynamic graph execution, where the computational graph is constructed and executed on the fly during the forward pass. This provides greater flexibility compared to static graph execution, allowing users to define networks with variable input sizes and conditional execution paths.
*   **Serialization and Deserialization:** NeuralChain provides built-in support for serializing and deserializing neural networks. This allows users to save trained models to disk and load them later for inference or further training. The framework uses the `pickle` module for serialization, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.
*   **Custom Layer Definition:** NeuralChain empowers users to define custom layers, adding specialized functionalities to the neural network. This involves creating a new class inheriting from the base `Layer` class, implementing the forward and backward passes, and incorporating it seamlessly into the network architecture. This facilitates the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the model.
*   **Flexible Data Handling:** The framework is designed to handle various data types and formats. It supports NumPy arrays as the primary data structure, enabling easy integration with existing data processing pipelines. The framework also provides utilities for data loading, preprocessing, and batching, making it easier to train models on large datasets.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The core programming language for the NeuralChain framework, providing a flexible and expressive environment for building neural networks.
*   **NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, used for efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations within the neural network layers.
*   **Pickle:** Used for serializing and deserializing the trained models. This allows to save models to disk and load them back.
*   **(Optional) CuPy:** A NumPy-compatible array library for GPU acceleration. NeuralChain can be configured to utilize CuPy for faster training and inference on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/NeuralChain.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    `cd NeuralChain`
3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    `python3 -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
4.  Install the required dependencies:

    `pip install numpy`
    `(Optional) pip install cupy-cudaXXX` (replace XXX with your CUDA version)

## Configuration

NeuralChain relies on minimal configuration. Most aspects of the network are defined directly in the Python code. However, there are a few environment variables that can be used to customize the behavior of the framework:

*   `NEURALCHAIN_USE_GPU`: Set to `True` to enable GPU acceleration using CuPy. Defaults to `False`. Ensure CuPy is installed if enabling GPU.
*   `NEURALCHAIN_DEVICE_ID`: Specifies the GPU device ID to use. Defaults to 0.

These variables can be set in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or directly in your script before running the NeuralChain code.

## Usage

Basic example:



API Documentation:

*   **Layer:** Base class for all neural network layers. Must implement `forward` and `backward` methods.
